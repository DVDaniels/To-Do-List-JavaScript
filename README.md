# To-Do-List Using JavaScript

This is a simple JavaScript To Do list app.

The user's to-do list is stored in local storage, so when the page refreshes the list is always there.

There is the possibility for the user to clear the list, by clicking the clear button, at the top right corner of the app.

The to do list app shows today's date to the user, for that we're using a method called toLocaleDateString, which you can read about here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString.
